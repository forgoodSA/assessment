# Forgood's candidate developer assessment
The purpose of this repo is to get a sense of a candidate software developer's aptitude, potential and level of experience.
It is designed as a pair-programming exercise between the candidate and the interviewer. It can be run over an hour or over 2 hours - indicative times are included in the questions below.

The things we're most interested in are:
 * What kind of application is this? (1 min)
 * How did you go about learning the codebase? (5 min)
 * How would you test this application? (10 min)
 * What changes would you make, and why? (45 min)
   * Anything goes.
   * This is a conversation, not a test, there are no right or wrong answers
